## Task

When using pi and any model I often run into this issue: https://github.com/earendil-works/pi/issues/7855

It seems adding max token info to `pi/models.json` helps resolving this issue.

Get the max token info for all models and upate the file.

I will then `task install pi` and check if it works.

@Clanker When task is completed set frontmatter state to review. Prompt the author to verify the results.

## Worklog

@Clanker Add a summary here once the task has been completed.

@Clanker If author confirms results set frontmatter state to completed, otherwise to aborted. Update date, harness and model. If you have access to session info also add token count.
